# Brand Voice & Writing Guidelines

## Voice Principles

### Our Voice Is...

#### 1. Clear Over Clever
We value understanding over wordplay. Our audience is busy—respect their time with direct, jargon-free communication.

**Instead of this:** "Leverage our synergistic platform to actualize your brand's paradigmatic potential."
**Write this:** "Use Brandora to discover what makes your brand unique and how to communicate it clearly."

---

#### 2. Empowering Over Prescriptive
We guide and enable, we don't dictate or lecture. Position users as capable decision-makers.

**Instead of this:** "You must complete all assessment sections to get results."
**Write this:** "Complete the assessment to unlock your personalized brand strategy."

---

#### 3. Conversational But Professional
We're the expert colleague, not the distant consultant or overly casual friend.

**Instead of this:** "Hey there! OMG, your brand is gonna be lit! 🔥"
**Write this:** "Welcome! We're excited to help you build a brand strategy that resonates with your ideal customers."

---

#### 4. Confident Without Arrogance
We know our expertise but acknowledge the complexity of business challenges.

**Instead of this:** "Our AI perfectly solves all your branding problems instantly."
**Write this:** "Our AI-powered platform guides you through proven brand strategy frameworks, helping you make informed positioning decisions."

---

#### 5. Data-Informed and Human
We balance analytical insights with empathy for the human experience.

**Instead of this:** "User cohort engagement metrics indicate suboptimal conversion trajectory."
**Write this:** "Your current positioning isn't connecting with your target audience. Here's how to improve it."

---

## Writing Style

### Sentence Structure

**Keep sentences concise:**
- **Target:** 15-20 words per sentence
- **Maximum:** 30 words
- **Vary length** for rhythm and readability

**Good example:**
"Brandora helps you discover your unique market position. We guide you through research, positioning, and messaging—giving you the clarity to compete with confidence."

**Too long:**
"Brandora is a platform that helps entrepreneurs and marketing professionals discover their unique market position by guiding them through a comprehensive process of research, positioning, and messaging development, ultimately giving them the clarity they need to compete with confidence in their respective markets."

---

### Active Voice Over Passive

**Passive voice** makes writing feel distant and weak.
**Active voice** is direct and engaging.

| Passive (Weak) | Active (Strong) |
|----------------|----------------|
| Your brand assessment will be analyzed by our AI. | Our AI analyzes your brand assessment. |
| Recommendations are generated based on your inputs. | We generate recommendations based on your inputs. |
| Results can be exported as a PDF. | Export your results as a PDF. |
| The platform was designed to be intuitive. | We designed the platform to be intuitive. |

**When passive is okay:**
- When the actor is unknown or unimportant
- When you want to emphasize the object, not the subject
- In technical documentation where it's conventional

---

### Jargon Usage

**Avoid unnecessary jargon**, but don't oversimplify for experts.

**Marketing/Business Jargon to Avoid:**
- ❌ Synergy
- ❌ Leverage (as a verb)
- ❌ Paradigm shift
- ❌ Disruptive innovation (overused)
- ❌ Bleeding edge
- ❌ Circle back
- ❌ Move the needle
- ❌ Low-hanging fruit

**Industry Terms That Are OK (Our Audience Knows Them):**
- ✓ Brand positioning
- ✓ Target audience
- ✓ Value proposition
- ✓ Messaging framework
- ✓ Competitive analysis
- ✓ Customer journey
- ✓ Brand architecture
- ✓ Go-to-market strategy

**Rule:** If you use industry terms, make sure they're precise and meaningful, not filler.

---

### Humor and Emotion

**When to use humor:**
- Social media content
- Friendly error messages
- Casual email communications
- Blog content (sparingly)

**When to avoid humor:**
- Critical error messages
- Pricing information
- Legal/privacy content
- First-time user onboarding (focus on clarity)
- Sensitive topics

**Examples of appropriate humor:**

**404 Page:**
"Looks like this page went on a strategy retreat. Let's get you back on track."

**Empty State:**
"No brand assessments yet. Ready to discover what makes your brand unique?"

**Social Media:**
"Plot twist: Your competitor's positioning shouldn't inspire yours. Your unique strengths should. 💡"

---

### Inclusive Language

**Use:**
- ✓ They/them/their as singular pronouns
- ✓ Folks, people, everyone (not "guys")
- ✓ Business owner, entrepreneur, professional
- ✓ Partner, spouse (not "wife/husband" unless specified)
- ✓ Parental leave (not "maternity leave" generically)
- ✓ Representative examples from diverse backgrounds

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Gendered language when unnecessary
- ❌ Assumptions about ability, age, culture
- ❌ Idioms that don't translate globally
- ❌ References that exclude parts of audience

**Examples:**

**Instead of:** "Any businessman knows that..."
**Write:** "Business owners know that..."

**Instead of:** "Hey guys, check out this feature..."
**Write:** "Check out this new feature..."

---

## Grammar and Mechanics

### Capitalization

**Brand Names:**
- Brandora (always capitalized, never all caps except in logos)
- Brand Assessment (capitalize product names)
- Pro Tier, Premium Tier, Enterprise Tier (capitalize tier names)

**Headings and Titles:**
- Use sentence case for most headings
- Example: "How to define your target audience"
- Not: "How To Define Your Target Audience"

**In UI:**
- Buttons: Sentence case ("Start free trial")
- Menu items: Sentence case ("Account settings")
- Form labels: Sentence case ("Email address")

**Exception:** All caps for overlines/eyebrows (sparingly)

---

### Punctuation

**Commas:**
- Use Oxford comma (serial comma)
  - Correct: "Research, positioning, and messaging"
  - Incorrect: "Research, positioning and messaging"

**Periods:**
- Use periods for complete sentences
- Skip periods for headlines, buttons, labels
- Use one space after a period, not two

**Dashes:**
- Em dash (—) for breaks in thought: "We help entrepreneurs—from solopreneurs to startups—build strong brands."
- En dash (–) for ranges: "2024–2025"
- Hyphen (-) for compound modifiers: "data-driven strategy"

**Ellipses:**
- Use sparingly
- Three dots with spaces: ". . ."
- Better: rephrase to eliminate

**Exclamation Points:**
- Use sparingly! (see what we did there?)
- Maximum one per page of content
- Never use multiple (!!!)
- Okay for success messages and celebrations

**Question Marks:**
- Use for direct questions
- Avoid in headlines unless truly asking a question

---

### Number Formatting

**Numbers:**
- Spell out one through nine
- Use numerals for 10 and above
- Exception: When used with a unit or in data
  - "3 minutes"
  - "5 steps"
  - "7-day trial"

**Large Numbers:**
- 1,000+ → Use comma separators (1,234)
- 10,000+ → Can use 10K in casual contexts
- 1,000,000+ → Can use 1M in casual contexts
- In formal contexts, write out or use commas (1,000,000)

**Percentages:**
- Use numeral + % symbol: "50% increase"
- Not: "fifty percent increase"

**Currency:**
- Use $ symbol: "$99/month"
- For clarity: "USD $99" in international contexts
- Range: "$99-$199" or "$99 to $199"

**Dates:**
- Month DD, YYYY → January 15, 2025
- Avoid MM/DD/YYYY (confusing internationally)
- In UI: "Jan 15, 2025" (abbreviated month is okay)

**Time:**
- Use 12-hour format: "2:00 PM EST"
- Include time zone when relevant

---

### Acronyms and Abbreviations

**First Use:**
- Spell out + acronym: "Artificial Intelligence (AI)"
- Subsequent uses: Just the acronym "AI"

**Common Acronyms (Don't Need to Spell Out):**
- AI, API, B2B, B2C, CEO, CTA, FAQ, PDF, ROI, SaaS, SEO, URL

**Less Common (Spell Out First Time):**
- SWOT, GTM, ICP, USP, TAM, CAC, LTV

**Brand-Specific:**
- BA (Brand Assessment) - spell out first time
- MP (Messaging Pillars) - spell out first time

---

### Contractions

**Use contractions** to sound conversational and approachable:
- We're (we are)
- You're (you are)
- It's (it is)
- Don't (do not)
- Can't (cannot)
- Won't (will not)
- Shouldn't (should not)

**Avoid contractions** in:
- Legal content
- Very formal documentation
- When you want to emphasize: "Do not share your password" (stronger than "Don't share")

---

You're 2 steps away from completing your brand assessment."

**Example - Blog Introduction:**
"How to Define Your Target Audience in 5 Steps

Your target audience isn't everyone who could buy from you—it's the specific group most likely to buy and benefit from your offer. The narrower your focus, the clearer your messaging and the more effective your marketing.

In this guide, we'll walk you through five proven steps to define your ideal customer, from analyzing your current base to creating detailed audience personas."

**Example - Tutorial Section:**
"Step 2: Identify Demographics

Start with the basics: age, location, income, education, job title. While demographics alone don't tell the whole story, they're essential for targeting your marketing.

Here's what to document:
• Age range (be specific: 28-45, not 25-50)
• Geographic location (country, region, or city)
• Income level or business revenue
• Job title or role
• Industry (if B2B)

Example: 'Marketing managers at B2B SaaS companies, aged 30-45, based in North America, at companies with 10-100 employees.'"

"Hi Marcus,

Thanks for reaching out. I understand how frustrating it is when exports aren't working as expected—let's get this fixed for you.

Can you tell me:
1. Which browser you're using
2. What happens when you click 'Export PDF'
3. Whether you see any error messages

Once I have these details, I'll have a solution for you.

Best,
Emma"

**Follow-Up:**
"Thanks for that info, Marcus. I see what's happening—this is a known issue with Safari 15. Here's how to fix it:

1. Update Safari to version 16 or later, OR
2. Use Chrome or Firefox for exports

I've also escalated this to our engineering team. We're working on a fix for legacy Safari versions that should ship next week.

Let me know if this solves it for you.

Emma"

**Resolution:**
"Perfect, glad that worked! Feel free to reach out if you run into anything else. Happy to help.

Emma"

### 5. Social Media

**Characteristics:**
- More conversational
- Can be playful (within brand)
- Engaging and dialogue-encouraging
- Timely and relevant
- Hashtags (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram)

**Example - LinkedIn Post:**
"Your brand isn't what you say it is. It's what your customers say it is.

But here's the thing: you can influence that perception through strategic positioning, consistent messaging, and authentic differentiation.

That's what brand strategy is all about.

What's one thing you wish customers understood about your brand? 👇

#BrandStrategy #Marketing #Entrepreneurship"

**Example - Twitter Thread:**
"🧵 5 signs you need to rework your brand positioning:

1/ You can't explain what you do in one sentence

2/ Prospects confuse you with competitors

3/ You compete primarily on price

4/ Your messaging changes based on who's writing it

5/ You're attracting the wrong customers

If 2+ of these hit close to home, it's time for a brand strategy refresh."

**Example - Instagram Story:**
"[Poll]
Quick question: How often do you revisit your brand positioning?

• Every quarter
• Once a year
• When something's not working
• What's brand positioning? 👀"

---

### 6. Email Communications

**Characteristics:**

## Writing for Different Audiences

### For Solopreneurs & Freelancers

**Tone:** Empowering, practical, budget-conscious
**Focus:** Quick wins, DIY-friendly, affordability

**Focus:** Scalability, investor-readiness, competitive advantage
