# How to Create Brand Guidelines That Actually Get Used

Most brand guidelines sit unused.

Companies invest thousands creating 60-page manuals documenting every possible brand application. Then team members never open them because they're too complex, too theoretical, or too hard to search.

Effective brand guidelines are practical tools team members reference daily—not impressive documents gathering digital dust.

Here's how to create guidelines that actually get used.

## Step 1: Document Strategic Foundation First

Guidelines need context. Start with why before how.

**Include:**
- Who we're for (target audience)
- What we stand for (brand positioning)
- How we're different (key differentiators)
- What we promise (brand promise)
- Why we exist (mission and vision)

This strategic foundation helps team members understand decisions behind visual and verbal guidelines.

**Keep it brief:** 1-2 pages maximum

## Step 2: Define Voice and Tone with Examples

Don't just list personality traits. Show how they work.

**For each voice characteristic:**
- Define what it means
- Provide do/don't examples
- Show how tone adapts by context

**Example:**

**Voice Characteristic:** Direct and clear

**What it means:** We get to the point. Short sentences. No fluff.

**Do:** "Strategy comes before design. Here's why."
**Don't:** "It is generally recommended that strategic considerations be undertaken prior to creative development..."

**Tone adaptation:**
- Marketing: Confident and inspiring
- Support: Patient and helpful
- Product: Clear and instructional

Examples make abstract principles concrete.

## Step 3: Create Visual Identity System

Document logo, colors, typography, imagery with usage rules.

**Logo System:**
- Primary logo with clear space requirements
- Secondary variations (horizontal, vertical, mark-only)
- Minimum sizes for print and digital
- Incorrect usage examples (stretched, recolored, crowded)
- File formats and where to access them

**Color Palette:**
- Primary, secondary, and neutral colors
- HEX, RGB, and CMYK codes
- Usage guidelines (primary for X, secondary for accents)
- Accessibility requirements (contrast ratios)

**Typography:**
- Heading and body fonts
- Type scale with sizes
- Font weights for different applications
- Web and print specifications
- Fallback fonts

**Imagery:**
- Photography style (examples)
- Illustration approach (if applicable)
- Icon style
- What to show/avoid

Provide actual files and resources, not just specifications.

## Step 4: Show Application Examples

Theory without examples doesn't help.

**Include mockups/examples:**
- Website pages
- Marketing emails
- Social media posts
- Presentations
- Business cards
- Documents

Seeing guidelines applied is more useful than reading abstract rules.

## Step 5: Create Templates and Assets

Make implementation easy.

**Provide:**
- Logo files (all formats: SVG, PNG, JPG)
- Color swatches (for design tools)
- Font files or web links
- Document templates (presentations, one-pagers)
- Social media templates
- Email signature templates

Accessible assets enable consistency.

## Step 6: Make It Searchable and Accessible

Complex PDFs are hard to use.

**Better formats:**
- Web-based (Notion, Google Sites, custom site)
- Searchable documentation platform
- Living document that's easy to update
- Mobile-friendly for quick reference

Team members should find what they need in seconds, not minutes.

## Step 7: Keep It Concise

Comprehensive ≠ long.

**Target:** 15-25 pages maximum
**Structure:**
- Strategic foundation (2 pages)
- Voice and messaging (3-4 pages)
- Visual identity (6-8 pages)
- Application examples (4-6 pages)
- Resources and contacts (1-2 pages)

If it's too long, people won't use it.

## Step 8: Train Your Team

Don't just share doc and hope for the best.

**Onboarding process:**
- Walk through guidelines with new team members
- Explain reasoning behind decisions
- Practice applying guidelines
- Answer questions
- Provide feedback on early applications

Active training creates usage, not just awareness.

## Step 9: Review and Update Regularly

Guidelines should evolve with your brand.

**Quarterly review:**
- Are team members using guidelines?
- Are there gaps or unclear areas?
- Has brand evolved in ways not yet documented?
- Are examples still relevant?

Update based on real-world use.

This is exactly what Brandora's guidelines module helps you create—practical documentation teams use.

## What to Include vs. Exclude

**Always include:**
- Strategic positioning summary
- Voice characteristics with examples
- Logo usage (correct and incorrect)
- Color palette with codes
- Typography system
- Core application templates
- Where to get assets

**Can usually exclude:**
- Exhaustive history
- Design philosophy essays
- Every possible edge case
- Overly rigid rules
- Internal process documentation

Focus on what enables daily work.

## Common Guideline Mistakes

**Making Them Too Long**

80-page manuals don't get read. Aim for 15-25 pages of practical guidance.

**Focusing on Rules, Not Enablement**

Guidelines should help people create on-brand work, not just restrict what they can't do.

**Creating Once and Never Updating**

Living brands need living guidelines. Quarterly reviews keep them relevant.

**Hiding Them in Hard-to-Access Places**

If team members can't find guidelines easily, they won't use them.

## FAQ

**How detailed should brand guidelines be?**

Detailed enough to ensure consistency, simple enough to use quickly. 15-25 pages with examples and templates is ideal for most businesses.

**Who should have access to brand guidelines?**

Everyone on the team. Brand consistency is everyone's responsibility, not just marketing's.

**Should we hire someone to design our guidelines?**

Nice-to-have but not required. Clear content matters more than beautiful formatting. Start with Google Docs or Notion, upgrade design later if needed.

**How often should we update guidelines?**

Review quarterly. Update when: brand evolves, team has questions about uncovered scenarios, or examples become outdated.

**What if our brand isn't fully developed yet?**

Document what you have. Even basic guidelines (logo usage, color palette, voice traits) create more consistency than none. Build comprehensively over time.

**Can guidelines be too restrictive?**

Yes. If rules prevent natural, effective communication, loosen them. Guidelines should enable, not straitjacket.

## The Bottom Line

Brand guidelines work when they're practical tools team members use daily—not impressive documents no one opens.

Create them by documenting strategic foundation, defining voice with examples, creating visual system, showing applications, providing templates, making them searchable, keeping them concise, training your team, and updating regularly.

Start with what you have. Document clearly. Make it accessible. Train your team. Update based on use.
