# How to Audit Your Current Brand

**Step 1: Evaluate Strategic Clarity**
Can you clearly answer: Who we're for? How we're different? What we promise? If not, positioning needs work.

**Step 2: Test Message Consistency**
Review website, marketing materials, sales conversations. Do they communicate same value proposition? Inconsistency indicates messaging gaps.

**Step 3: Assess Visual Coherence**
Compare touchpoints visually. Do logo usage, colors, typography stay consistent? Random visuals signal weak guidelines.

**Step 4: Analyze Customer Understanding**
Ask customers: "How would you describe us to others?" Their language reveals perception gaps.

**Step 5: Review Competitive Differentiation**
Compare your messaging to competitors'. Can customers tell you apart? Similarity indicates weak positioning.

**Step 6: Measure Brand Performance**
Track: brand awareness, message recall, differentiation perception, customer acquisition cost, pricing power. Metrics reveal strengths and weaknesses.

**Step 7: Document Findings and Prioritize**
List gaps by impact and effort. Fix high-impact, low-effort issues first.

# How to Reposition Your Brand

**Step 1: Identify Why Repositioning Is Needed**
Market shifted? Grown beyond original positioning? Weak differentiation? Clear "why" guides approach.

**Step 2: Research Target Positioning**
Where do you want to be positioned? Validate with target customers. Ensure gap is meaningful and ownable.

**Step 3: Assess Current Customer Impact**
Will existing customers feel alienated? Can you serve both current and target customers? If not, plan transition.

**Step 4: Develop Transition Strategy**
Gradual evolution vs. dramatic shift. Most successful repositioning is evolutionary, not revolutionary.

**Step 5: Update Messaging First**
Shift language before visual identity. Test new positioning through marketing messages.

**Step 6: Communicate Change to Stakeholders**
Tell existing customers why you're evolving. Explain value to them. Transparency builds trust.

**Step 7: Implement Systematically**
Update website, marketing, sales materials in coordinated rollout. Consistency prevents confusion.

**Step 8: Monitor and Refine**
Track how repositioning lands. Customer feedback reveals if transition is working.

# How to Extend Your Brand Into New Markets

**Step 1: Validate Market Fit**
Does your core positioning apply to new market? If fundamental value proposition doesn't translate, extension may require new brand.

**Step 2: Identify What Stays vs. Changes**
Core brand (positioning, values) typically stays constant. Messaging emphasis and examples adapt by market.

**Step 3: Research New Market Specifics**
Understand new audience: language, priorities, decision criteria, competitive landscape. Don't assume translation is simple.

**Step 4: Adapt Messaging, Not Positioning**
Same brand promise, different emphasis. Example: B2B SaaS tool expanding to non-profits emphasizes affordability more than original B2B messaging.

**Step 5: Create Market-Specific Proof**
New audiences need relevant case studies, testimonials, examples. Generic proof doesn't build credibility.

**Step 6: Test Before Full Commitment**
Pilot with small segment. Validate positioning resonates before major investment.

**Step 7: Maintain Brand Consistency**
Visual identity, voice, and core values stay consistent. Market-specific adaptation happens at messaging and proof level, not brand foundation.
