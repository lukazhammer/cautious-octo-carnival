# How to Audit Your Current Brand (And Identify What's Not Working)

Brand audits reveal gaps between intended positioning and actual perception. Here's how to evaluate your brand systematically and identify what needs fixing.

## Step 1: Evaluate Strategic Clarity

Can you clearly answer these questions?
- Who exactly are we for?
- How are we different from alternatives?
- What do we promise customers?
- Why should they believe us?

If any answer is vague, your positioning needs work.

**Action:** Write one-sentence answers to each question. If you struggle or answers sound generic, strategic foundation is weak.

## Step 2: Test Message Consistency

Review all customer-facing content:
- Website homepage and key pages
- Marketing emails and campaigns
- Sales presentations and collateral
- Social media profiles and posts
- Support documentation

**Questions:**
- Do they communicate same value proposition?
- Is voice consistent across channels?
- Do differentiators appear uniformly?

Inconsistency indicates missing messaging framework.

## Step 3: Assess Visual Coherence

Compare brand applications side-by-side:
- Logo usage (sizing, spacing, variations)
- Color application
- Typography consistency
- Photography/imagery style
- Design patterns

**Red flags:**
- Logos stretched or incorrectly colored
- Random color choices beyond palette
- Inconsistent fonts
- Mismatched visual styles

Visual inconsistency signals weak or unused brand guidelines.

## Step 4: Analyze Customer Understanding

Ask 10-15 customers: "How would you describe us to someone who's never heard of us?"

**Listen for:**
- Can they articulate your differentiation?
- Do they use language from your positioning?
- Do answers align with intended positioning?
- What do they emphasize (may differ from your emphasis)?

Gap between intended and perceived positioning reveals messaging problems.

## Step 5: Review Competitive Differentiation

Compare your website messaging to top 3-5 competitors:
- Do headlines emphasize similar things?
- Could your copy work on competitor sites?
- Can prospects easily distinguish you?

If messaging is interchangeable, differentiation is weak.

**Test:** Show your homepage to someone unfamiliar with your industry alongside competitors. Can they identify meaningful differences?

## Step 6: Measure Brand Performance

Track quantitative indicators:

**Awareness:** Do target customers know you exist?
**Recall:** Do they remember your brand after exposure?
**Differentiation:** Can they articulate how you're different?
**Preference:** Do they choose you over alternatives when aware of both?
**Pricing power:** Can you charge premium vs. competitors?
**CAC:** Is customer acquisition cost rising or falling?

Weak numbers reveal weak branding.

## Step 7: Document Findings and Prioritize

Create audit summary:

**Strategic gaps:** Positioning unclear, differentiation weak, promise not defined
**Messaging gaps:** Inconsistent messages, wrong emphasis, generic language
**Visual gaps:** Inconsistent application, outdated design, poor guidelines
**Perception gaps:** Customer understanding differs from intention

**Prioritize by impact:**
- High impact, low effort: Fix immediately
- High impact, high effort: Plan systematically
- Low impact: Defer or skip

This is exactly what Brandora's audit module helps you identify—gaps that need strategic attention.

## Common Audit Findings

**Finding:** "We can't clearly articulate differentiation"
**Solution:** Revisit positioning strategy, competitive analysis

**Finding:** "Messaging is inconsistent across team"
**Solution:** Create messaging framework and train team

**Finding:** "Customers describe us differently than we describe ourselves"
**Solution:** Either shift messaging to match perception or invest in changing perception

**Finding:** "Visual identity is applied randomly"
**Solution:** Create or update brand guidelines, train team on usage

**Finding:** "We look/sound like competitors"
**Solution:** Strengthen differentiation through positioning work

## FAQ

**How often should we audit our brand?**

Annually at minimum. More frequently if: major business changes, significant market shifts, new competitors emerge, or brand performance declines.

**Who should conduct the audit?**

Internal team can do basic audit. External perspective (consultant or platform like Brandora) reveals blind spots internal teams miss.

**What if audit reveals major problems?**

Prioritize fixes by business impact. Strategic gaps (positioning, differentiation) before cosmetic updates (visual refresh).

**How long does brand audit take?**

2-4 weeks for thorough audit including customer research. Basic internal audit: 1 week.

**Should we pause marketing while fixing brand?**

No. Fix incrementally while maintaining momentum. Start with highest-impact changes, implement systematically.

**What if customers like current brand but we think it's weak?**

Customer satisfaction matters. But if business metrics (growth, pricing, CAC) are poor, brand may need strategic strengthening even if existing customers are happy.

## The Bottom Line

Brand audits identify gaps between strategy and execution, intention and perception. Systematic evaluation reveals what's working and what needs fixing.

Audit by evaluating strategic clarity, testing message consistency, assessing visual coherence, analyzing customer understanding, reviewing competitive differentiation, measuring performance, and prioritizing fixes.

Start with strategic foundation (positioning, differentiation, messaging). Visual updates come after strategy is strong.
