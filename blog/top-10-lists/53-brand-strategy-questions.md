# 10 Essential Brand Strategy Questions Every Founder Must Answer

These 10 questions form the foundation of every strong brand strategy. Answer them clearly and you have positioning that drives growth. Skip them and you default to commodity competition.

Work through each question systematically before investing in marketing, design, or growth.

## 1. Who Exactly Are We For?

**Why this matters:**
"Everyone" is strategic failure. Specific targeting creates resonant messaging, efficient marketing, and defensible positioning.

**How to answer:**
Define ideal customer with specifics:
- Demographics: Age, income, location, role, company size
- Psychographics: Values, priorities, attitudes
- Behaviors: How they buy, what they value
- Situation: What triggers their search for your solution

**Good answers:**
- "Series A SaaS companies ($2M-$10M ARR) transitioning from founder-led sales to professional go-to-market"
- "Active women 28-45 who prioritize clean ingredients, skeptical of mainstream beauty marketing, willing to pay premium for transparency"
- "Solo freelance designers earning $50-$150K who want to specialize and command premium rates"

**Bad answers:**
- "Small businesses"
- "Anyone who needs [category]"
- "B2B companies"

**Test:** Can your ideal customer read description and say "this is exactly me"? If not, too broad.

## 2. What Problem Do We Solve (That Matters to Them)?

**Why this matters:**
You might solve problem customer doesn't care about. Or solve problem they care about but position it poorly. Alignment between what you solve and what they value is critical.

**How to answer:**
Not what your product does. What customer problem it solves.

**Framework:**
- **Surface problem:** What they initially think they need
- **Real problem:** What's actually causing pain
- **Why it matters:** Impact on their business/life
- **Cost of unsolved:** What happens if problem persists

**Good answers:**
- "Marketing agencies lose deals because generic positioning creates price competition. They need vertical specialization to command premiums and win without discounting."
- "ML teams moving to production spend 60% of time debugging data issues instead of improving models. They need data versioning that prevents pipeline breaks."

**Bad answers:**
- "We help companies be more efficient"
- "We solve communication problems"
- "We make processes better"

**Test:** Would customer pay money to solve this problem? If yes, how much? If they wouldn't pay, not real problem.

## 3. How Are We Different (and Why Does It Matter)?

**Why this matters:**
"Better" isn't differentiation. Everyone claims better. Differentiation must be specific, provable, and valuable.

**How to answer:**
Choose differentiation axis:
- **Different target:** Specific vs. broad
- **Different approach:** Unique methodology
- **Different outcome:** Specific result others don't achieve
- **Different values:** Mission or ethics
- **Different business model:** How you deliver value

**Framework:**
"Unlike [alternative], we [specific differentiation] which means [customer benefit]."

**Good answers:**
- "Unlike full-service agencies serving all industries, we specialize exclusively in healthcare marketing with HIPAA expertise, which means faster results and compliance confidence."
- "Unlike project management tools built for co-located teams, we're async-first for distributed teams, which means no timezone nightmare meetings."

**Bad answers:**
- "We provide better service"
- "Our product is higher quality"
- "We're more innovative"

**Test:** Could competitor make same claim? If yes, not differentiation.

## 4. Why Should They Believe Us?

**Why this matters:**
Claims are worthless without proof. Trust is earned through evidence.

**How to answer:**
Provide credibility markers:
- **Track record:** Results you've delivered
- **Expertise:** Background and credentials
- **Social proof:** Testimonials, case studies
- **Data:** Metrics and outcomes
- **Authority:** Recognition, media, awards

**Good answers:**
- "We've scaled 15 Series A SaaS companies to Series B with average 3.2x revenue growth. Former VP Revenue at [Tech Company]. Featured in [Publications]."
- "78% of our participants achieve housing and employment stability within 18 months (vs. 20% statewide average). 10 years serving this community. Recognized by [Award]."

**Bad answers:**
- "Years of experience"
- "Trusted by clients"
- "Award-winning" (which award?)

**Test:** Is proof specific and verifiable? Generic claims don't build trust.

## 5. What Do We Want to Be Known For?

**Why this matters:**
You can't own every attribute. Choose what you'll be famous for and accept what you won't.

**How to answer:**
Pick 1-2 primary associations:
- **Functional:** What you deliver
- **Emotional:** How you make them feel
- **Social:** What choosing you says about them

**Good answers:**
- "The ML data versioning experts. When production data breaks, we're the solution."
- "The freelancer branding specialist who helps designers command $15K+ projects."
- "The healthcare marketing agency that understands HIPAA and patient privacy."

**Bad answers:**
- "Quality, innovation, service, and results" (trying to own everything)
- "The best [category]" (vague)

**Test:** If someone mentions your brand, what one thing should come to mind? That's your positioning.

## 6. Who Are We Really Competing Against?

**Why this matters:**
Customers don't just compare you to obvious competitors. Understanding true competitive set reveals positioning opportunities.

**How to answer:**
Three competitive levels:
- **Direct competitors:** Same solution, same target
- **Indirect competitors:** Different solution, same problem
- **Status quo:** Doing nothing or DIY

**Good answers:**
"Direct: Other healthcare marketing agencies
Indirect: Generalist agencies, freelance marketing help
Status quo: In-house marketing team with no healthcare expertise

We win against agencies through specialization. We win against status quo by demonstrating healthcare expertise ROI."

**Bad answers:**
- "No real competitors"
- "We're unique"
- Just listing company names

**Test:** When prospect considers options, what are they really choosing between?

## 7. What's Our Brand Promise?

**Why this matters:**
Promise articulates what customers can expect consistently. Broken promises destroy brand.

**How to answer:**
Commit to specific, deliverable outcome:
- **What you guarantee**
- **What customer can count on**
- **What you won't compromise**

**Good answers:**
- "30-minute average response time, always. We know your questions can't wait."
- "78% of participants achieve independence within 18 months, or we haven't succeeded."
- "Your projects ship on time and on budget, or we eat the cost."

**Bad answers:**
- "We'll do our best"
- "Quality work"
- "Customer satisfaction"

**Test:** Would you put money on delivering this consistently? If not, not real promise.

## 8. How Do We Want Customers to Feel?

**Why this matters:**
Emotional connection drives loyalty beyond rational features.

**How to answer:**
Choose 3-4 emotional outcomes:
- **Relief:** From stress, uncertainty, risk
- **Confidence:** In decisions, capabilities
- **Pride:** In choice, identity
- **Excitement:** About possibilities
- **Belonging:** To community, movement

**Good answers:**
- "Relief (data won't break production), confidence (systems are robust), pride (in technical excellence)"
- "Empowered (can command premium rates), confident (in expertise), proud (of positioning)"

**Bad answers:**
- "Happy"
- "Satisfied"
- Generic positive emotions

**Test:** Specific emotion customers describe after working with you? That's your emotional positioning.

## 9. What Would Make Us Walk Away From a Deal?

**Why this matters:**
Saying no defines brand as much as saying yes. Boundaries create focus.

**How to answer:**
Identify dealbreakers:
- **Wrong fit client:** Who isn't ideal customer
- **Scope creep:** What you don't do
- **Values misalignment:** Ethical boundaries
- **Pricing pressure:** Won't discount below threshold

**Good answers:**
- "We turn down non-healthcare clients, even when we need revenue. Specialization is our positioning."
- "We don't do hourly billing or discount below our value. Premium positioning requires premium pricing."
- "We won't work with companies whose values contradict our mission."

**Bad answers:**
- "We'll work with anyone"
- "Whatever the customer needs"

**Test:** Have you actually walked away from money because customer didn't fit positioning? That's brand discipline.

## 10. What Metrics Prove Our Brand Is Working?

**Why this matters:**
Can't improve what you don't measure. Brand effectiveness shows up in business metrics.

**How to answer:**
Define measurable brand indicators:
- **Awareness:** Do target customers know you exist?
- **Consideration:** Are you in competitive evaluations?
- **Preference:** Do customers choose you over alternatives?
- **Pricing:** Can you command premium?
- **Loyalty:** Do customers stay and refer?

**Good answers:**
"Brand success metrics:
- Inbound leads: 60% of pipeline
- Close rate: 40% (vs. 18% before positioning)
- Average deal size: $25K (vs. $15K)
- Customer retention: 90%+ annually
- Referrals: 40% of new customers"

**Bad answers:**
- "Social media followers"
- "Website traffic"
- Metrics disconnected from business outcomes

**Test:** Do these metrics directly connect to revenue and profit? If not, vanity metrics.

## How to Use These Questions

**Step 1: Answer individually**
Write answers to each question independently first.

**Step 2: Check alignment**
Do answers form coherent story? Contradictions reveal unclear strategy.

**Step 3: Test with customers**
Interview ideal customers. Do your answers resonate?

**Step 4: Document strategy**
Formalize answers into positioning document.

**Step 5: Audit execution**
Does your website, marketing, sales reflect these answers?

**Step 6: Iterate annually**
Markets evolve. Review answers yearly.

## Red Flags in Your Answers

**Warning signs of weak positioning:**
- Answers could apply to competitors
- You're hedging ("kind of," "mostly," "sort of")
- Team members answer differently
- Too broad or too vague
- No specific examples or proof
- You're uncomfortable committing

**If you see these:** Strategy isn't clear yet. Keep refining.
