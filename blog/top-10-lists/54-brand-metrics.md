Brand building without measurement is hope, not strategy. These 10 metrics prove whether your brand is driving business outcomes or just looking pretty.

Track what matters. Ignore vanity metrics. Connect brand to revenue.

## 1. Brand-Driven Revenue (Percent of Revenue from Inbound)

**What it measures:**
Percentage of revenue from customers who found you vs. you found them.

**Why it matters:**

```

**Benchmarks:**

## 2. Brand Search Volume

**What it measures:**

- Thought leadership and content
- PR and media mentions

## 3. Consideration Rate (Competitive Win Rate)

**What it measures:**
When prospects evaluate multiple options, how often do you make their shortlist and win?

**Why it matters:**
Brand strength shows up in competitive situations. Strong brands get considered more often and win more deals.

**How to measure:**
```
Consideration rate = (Deals where you were considered / Total opportunities) × 100

Win rate = (Deals won / Deals you were considered for) × 100
```

**Track:**

## 4. Price Premium (vs. Alternatives)

**What it measures:**
How much more (or less) you can charge compared to competitors for equivalent offering.

**Why it matters:**

```

## 5. Net Promoter Score (NPS)

**What it measures:**
Likelihood customers will recommend you to others (0-10 scale).

**Why it matters:**
Brand loyalty shows up in advocacy. High NPS predicts word-of-mouth growth and low churn.

**How to measure:**
Ask: "How likely are you to recommend us to a colleague? (0-10)"

**Calculate:**
- Promoters (9-10): Loyal enthusiasts
- Passives (7-8): Satisfied but unenthusiastic
- Detractors (0-6): Unhappy, may damage brand

```
NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors
```

**Benchmarks:**
- Poor: <0 (more detractors than promoters)
- Good: 0-30
- Great: 30-50
- Excellent: 50-70
- World-class: 70+

**Example:**
Survey 100 customers:
- 60 promoters (60%)
- 30 passives (30%)
- 10 detractors (10%)

**NPS = 60% - 10% = 50**

**How to improve:**

## 6. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) by Source

**What it measures:**

```

- Paid: Lower LTV (less pre-qualified)

**Example:**
Organic customer LTV: $25,000
Paid customer LTV: $12,000
**Brand-driven customers 2.1x more valuable**

**How to improve:**
- Attract customers aligned with positioning

Average days from first contact to closed deal.

**Why it matters:**
