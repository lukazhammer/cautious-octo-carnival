#BrandStrategy #[IndustryTag]
```

**Example - Agency Branding:**
```
After working with 50+ agencies on positioning, I've noticed something:

The most profitable agencies all do one thing differently.

They stopped trying to serve everyone.

I see this pattern constantly:

Struggling agency: "We help businesses with marketing"
Thriving agency: "We help healthcare practices acquire patients"

Here's what happens when you niche:

→ Premium pricing becomes easier
   Vertical expertise = higher perceived value

→ Marketing becomes simpler
   You know exactly where your ideal clients hang out

→ Referrals increase dramatically
   "You need healthcare marketing? Call these people."

This is exactly what I cover in "How to Brand Your Agency":

#BrandStrategy #Branding101

**LinkedIn:**
I just reviewed 100 startup websites.

87 of them made the same expensive mistake:

They invested $10K-50K in beautiful branding... before defining their strategy.

The result? Gorgeous assets that don't connect with their market.

Here's why strategy must come first:

Fill in the blanks = clarity.

#Positioning #BrandStrategy

**LinkedIn:**
The best brand positioning I've seen recently:

"Slack is a collaboration hub for work."

1. Research: Interview 10 customers

You need both.

Strategy determines WHAT to design.
Canva helps you design it beautifully.

Your brand positioning should happen BEFORE product-market fit, not after.

Why?

Positioning determines which market you're fitting into.

**LinkedIn:**
Freelancers: You're not charging enough.

Here's why:

You're positioning yourself as a generalist designer.

You could charge 3-5x more.

**Subject:** `The #1 brand mistake (are you making it?)`

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

The #1 brand mistake?

Starting with a logo before defining strategy.

Here's what happens:

1. Founder hires designer
2. Designer creates beautiful logo/identity
3. Founder launches with gorgeous assets
4. Assets don't connect with the market
5. Founder blames "branding doesn't work"

**The problem:** Beautiful design can't fix unclear positioning.

**The solution:** Strategy first, design second.
