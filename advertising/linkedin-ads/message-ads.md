## Message Ad 1: For Marketing Leaders
**Subject:** Quick question about your brand positioning

**Message:**

Hi {{firstName}},

I noticed you're leading marketing at {{company}}—impressive growth trajectory you've got there.

Quick question: Does your team have documented brand positioning that everyone references consistently? Or is it more... scattered?

Most marketing leaders tell us their brand strategy lives in someone's head, an old deck, or varies by who you ask. This creates expensive inefficiencies.

We built Brandora to solve this. It's a platform that helps marketing teams document comprehensive brand strategy—positioning, messaging, differentiation—in about 30 minutes. Then everyone works from the same playbook.

Used by marketing teams at 10,000+ companies. Might be worth 15 minutes to see if it fits your needs?

## Message Ad 2: For Startup Founders
**Subject:** Investor-ready brand positioning

**Message:**

Hi {{firstName}},

Congrats on {{company}}! Saw your recent announcement—exciting stuff.

Here's something we've learned from working with 1,000+ startup founders: investors fund clarity, not confusion.

The startups that successfully raise have crystal-clear answers to:
- What makes you different from alternatives?
- Who is your ideal customer and why?
- What unique value do you provide?

Sounds simple. Incredibly hard to articulate well.

Brandora helps founders develop investor-ready brand positioning in about 30 minutes. Same frameworks consultants charge $15K for. Accessible pricing. Instant implementation.

Worth exploring before your next pitch?

## Message Ad 3: For Agency Owners
**Subject:** Streamline your client brand strategy process

**Message:**

Hi {{firstName}},

Fellow agency professional here. Quick question about your brand strategy process:

How long does it typically take your team to develop comprehensive brand positioning for a new client?

Most agencies tell us 2-4 weeks of research and strategy work. That's a lot of non-billable hours before you can start the creative work that clients actually pay for.

We built Brandora to help agencies:
- Standardize the brand strategy process
- Deliver consistent quality across clients
- Reduce strategy development time by 70%
- Increase margins on brand projects

Several agencies use it as their core brand strategy platform. Some white-label it for clients.

## Message Ad 5: For E-commerce Founders
**Subject:** Stand out in crowded marketplaces

**Message:**

Hi {{firstName}},

Running an e-commerce brand is tough. Shopify alone has 2M+ stores. Amazon has 6M+ sellers. How do you stand out?

Price race to the bottom? Not sustainable.
Better products? Everyone says that.
Paid ads? Expensive and temporary.

The answer: Strategic brand differentiation.

The e-commerce brands that win have clear positioning that makes them the obvious choice for a specific customer segment. They don't try to appeal to everyone—they dominate a niche.

Brandora helps e-commerce founders discover their unique positioning and communicate it across every touchpoint. From product pages to ads to emails.

Used by 1,000+ e-commerce brands to clarify messaging and increase conversions.

## Best Practices for LinkedIn Message Ads

### Character Limits:
- **Subject Line:** 60 characters max (recommended: 40-50)
- **Message Body:** 1,500 characters max (recommended: 500-1,000)
- **CTA Button:** 20 characters max
- **Custom Footer:** 2,500 characters (optional)

### Personalization Tokens:
- {{firstName}} - Recipient's first name
- {{lastName}} - Recipient's last name
- {{company}} - Recipient's company name
- {{companySize}} - Number of employees
- {{industry}} - Recipient's industry
- {{title}} - Recipient's job title

**Usage:** Use sparingly. Over-personalization feels creepy. 1-2 tokens is optimal.

### Tone Guidelines:

**Do:**
- Write conversationally (like a real message)
- Lead with value, not sales pitch
- Ask questions to engage
- Respect their time
- Provide clear next step
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)

**Don't:**
- Write like an ad
- Use heavy sales language
- Go straight to hard sell
- Write walls of text
- Use multiple CTAs
- Be overly formal or stiff

### Subject Line Best Practices:

**Effective Patterns:**
- Question format: "Quick question about [relevant topic]"
- Curiosity: "Noticed something about {{company}}"
- Value prop: "Idea for [solving specific problem]"
- Mutual connection: "We work with companies like {{company}}"
- Direct: "Better way to [do specific task]"

**Avoid:**
- Salesy language: "Special offer just for you!"
- ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation!!!
- Generic: "You've been selected"
- Misleading: Making it seem like personal outreach when it's an ad
- Clickbait: "You won't believe this..."

### Message Structure:

**Opening (First 2 lines):**
- Acknowledge them personally
- Show you understand their context
- Hook with relevant insight or question

**Body (Middle section):**
- Identify problem/pain point
- Provide context or insight
- Introduce solution naturally
- Social proof or credibility

**Close (Last 2 lines):**
- Soft CTA (not pushy)
- Clear next step
- Respect their choice

### CTA Button Options:

**Awareness Stage:**

### Targeting Recommendations:

**For Message Ads, Target:**

### Delivery & Timing:

### Performance Metrics:

**Key Metrics:**
- Open rate: 40-55% is good
- Click-through rate: 3-5% is good

- Response rate: 1-3% is solid

**Optimization Signals:**

### A/B Testing:

**Test Variables:**
1. **Subject Line:** Question vs. statement
2. **Opening:** Problem vs. solution focused
3. **Length:** Short (300 chars) vs. long (800 chars)
4. **Personalization:** Heavy vs. light
5. **CTA:** Direct vs. soft
6. **Tone:** Formal vs. casual

**Testing Protocol:**
- Test one variable at a time
- Run for at least 500 sends per variant

### Compliance & Best Practices:

**LinkedIn Policies:**
- Must be clearly identified as ad

3. Display Retargeting (continue journey)
