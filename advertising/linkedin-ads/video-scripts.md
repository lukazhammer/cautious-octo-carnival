**[10-30 sec - The Problem]**
VISUAL: Examples of common positioning mistakes
EXPERT: "Most businesses can tell you what they do. Very few can clearly articulate why someone should choose them over alternatives. That's positioning. And it's expensive to get wrong."

VISUAL: Brand agencies, consultants, price tags
EXPERT: "Traditionally, you'd hire a brand consultant. $15K to $50K. Three to six months. You'd get beautiful strategy documents. But implementation? That's on you. Most strategies end up in a drawer."
