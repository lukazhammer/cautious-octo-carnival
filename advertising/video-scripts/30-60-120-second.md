**[45-75 sec - Discovery & Implementation]**
VISUAL: Finding and using Brandora
CUSTOMER: "Then I discovered Brandora. For one forty-nine a month, we could get professional positioning frameworks. I was skeptical—how could AI deliver what consultants charge thirty K for?

The recommendations were specific, actionable, and aligned with real strategic frameworks I recognized from my MBA."

**[75-105 sec - Implementation Process]**

CUSTOMER: "Two months later: bounce rate down to thirty-five percent. Conversion rate up forty percent. Sales cycle shortened by thirty percent.
