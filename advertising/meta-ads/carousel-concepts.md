## Carousel Best Practices

### Design Guidelines:

**Visual Consistency:**

**Image Specifications:**
- **Aspect Ratio:** 1:1 (square) recommended
- **Resolution:** 1080 x 1080 pixels minimum
- **Format:** JPG or PNG
- **File Size:** Under 30MB per image
- **Safe Zone:** Keep important elements in center 90%

**Text on Images:**
- Minimal text (20% rule deprecated but still best practice)
- High contrast for readability
- Large enough for mobile viewing
- Brandora fonts when possible

### Copy Guidelines:

**Primary Text:**
- Hook in first sentence
- Explain carousel purpose
- Include CTA language
- 125 characters recommended (full text visible)

**Headlines (per card):**
- 40 characters maximum
- Clear, benefit-focused
- Action-oriented when appropriate
- Consistent format across cards

**Descriptions (per card):**
- 20 characters recommended
- Concise value statement
- Complement headline, don't repeat
- Drive to CTA

**Link Descriptions:**
- 30 characters maximum
- Appear below primary text
- Additional context if needed

### Structural Best Practices:

**Number of Cards:**
- Minimum: 2 cards
- Maximum: 10 cards
- Optimal: 5-7 cards (best engagement)
- Progressive story or comparison

**Card Order:**
- First card is most important (many won't swipe)
- Last card should have strongest CTA
- Middle cards build the case
- Logical flow/progression

**CTAs:**
- Can be same across all cards OR
- Unique per card (more flexible)
- Final card should have strongest CTA
- Test "Learn More" vs. "Sign Up" vs. "Start Free"

### Performance Optimization:

**Testing Variations:**
1. **Card Order:** Change sequence, test performance
2. **Image Style:** Photos vs. graphics vs. screenshots
3. **CTA Variation:** Different buttons per segment
4. **Number of Cards:** 3 vs. 5 vs. 7 card tests
5. **Story Type:** Process vs. comparison vs. social proof

**Engagement Metrics:**
- Outbound click-through rate (CTR)
- Average engagement time
- Swipe-through rate (cards viewed)
- Cost per click (CPC)
- Conversion rate
- Cost per acquisition (CPA)

**Optimization Signals:**
- If card 1 CTR is high but swipe-through low = strengthen story
- If swipes high but conversions low = improve CTA/offer
- If early exit = front-load value
- If high completion but low clicks = CTA not compelling

### Platform-Specific Notes:

**Facebook Feed:**
- First card gets most visibility
- Older audiences may not swipe as much
- Educational carousels perform well
- Comparison carousels drive consideration

**Instagram Feed:**
- Swipe behavior more common

- Younger audience explores more cards

**Facebook/Instagram Stories:**

### Advanced Tactics:
