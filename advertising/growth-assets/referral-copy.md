## Invitation Email Templates

### Email Template 1: Direct Value

**Subject:** "I found something that helped my brand strategy (you'll want this)"

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

I know you're working on [business/project]. I wanted to share something that really helped me get clarity on my brand positioning.

It's called Brandora—an AI-powered brand strategy platform. Basically, it walks you through the same frameworks brand consultants use (who charge $15K+), but at a fraction of the cost.

I went through their 30-minute assessment and got:
- Clear positioning statement
- Competitive differentiation strategy
- Messaging frameworks
- 50+ ready-to-use templates

The insights were honestly better than the $5K I almost spent on a consultant last year.

Since it helped me so much, I wanted to share. If you use my link, you'll get 20% off:
[Personal Referral Link]

No pressure—just thought it might help you like it helped me.

[Your Name]

P.S. – If you try it, let me know what you think!

### Email Template 2: Problem-Focused

**Subject:** "Struggling with brand positioning? This helped me"

**Body:**

[Name],

Remember when we talked about how hard it is to clearly explain what makes your business different?

I finally found something that helped: Brandora.

It's an AI-powered brand strategy platform that guides you through professional positioning frameworks. The kind agencies charge $15K for.

What I got:
✓ Crystal-clear understanding of my unique value
✓ Positioning that differentiates from competitors
✓ Messaging that actually converts
✓ Templates to implement everything

The assessment takes about 30 minutes and the insights are incredibly specific to your business (not generic template stuff).

If you're interested, here's my referral link for 20% off:

Worth trying if you're working on positioning.

**Subject:** "The tool that helped me 3X my conversion rate"

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

Quick share: I just 3X'd my website conversion rate.

The secret? Better brand positioning.

I used a platform called Brandora to completely rework how I communicate my value. 30-minute AI-powered assessment. Professional frameworks. Personalized recommendations.

The results:
- Bounce rate: 70% → 35%
- Conversion rate: 2% → 6%
- Sales cycle: 6 weeks → 3 weeks

All because I got crystal clear on my positioning and messaging.
