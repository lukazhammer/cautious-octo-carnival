## Cold Email Template 1: Business Coaches & Consultants

**Subject:** "Tool for your entrepreneurial clients"

**Email:**

Hi [Name],

I see you work with entrepreneurs and small business owners—helping them grow and scale their businesses.

Quick question: How often do your clients struggle with clearly articulating their value proposition or market positioning?

In my experience with coaches: constantly. It's one of the most common challenges entrepreneurs face.

Here's why I'm reaching out:

Brandora is a brand strategy platform many business coaches recommend to clients. It guides entrepreneurs through professional positioning frameworks in about 30 minutes. Gives them the clarity that makes coaching more effective.

Some coaches are:
- Recommending it to all clients (we have an affiliate program)
- Using it in group coaching programs
- Building it into their methodology
- Partnering to offer it as an upgrade

Would love to explore how we might work together. 15-minute call this week?

## Cold Email Template 2: Marketing Agencies

**Subject:** "Streamline your client brand strategy process"

**Email:**

[Name],

Fellow agency professional here. Quick question about your brand strategy process:

How long does it typically take your team to develop comprehensive brand positioning for a new client?

Most agencies tell us: 2-4 weeks of research and strategy work. That's a lot of non-billable hours before the creative work clients actually pay for.

We built Brandora to help agencies:
✓ Standardize the brand strategy process
✓ Deliver consistent quality across clients
✓ Reduce strategy development time by 70%
✓ Increase margins on brand projects

Several agencies use it as their core brand strategy platform. Some white-label it for clients.

Interested in a 15-minute demo to see if it fits your process?

## Cold Email Template 3: Accelerators & Incubators

**Subject:** "Brand strategy platform for your cohort"

**Email:**

Hi [Name],

Congratulations on [Accelerator]'s recent cohort announcement—exciting group of startups.

I'm reaching out because we work with several accelerators to help their cohort companies build professional brand positioning.

The problem: Most early-stage startups have unclear positioning. It costs them customers, investors, and growth. They need brand strategy but can't afford $15K agencies.

Brandora provides:
- AI-powered brand strategy platform
- Professional positioning frameworks
- 30-minute assessments, instant results
- Startup-friendly pricing

Partnership opportunities:
1. **Cohort License:** All companies get access
2. **Workshop Integration:** Brand strategy sessions
3. **Mentor Resource:** Tool mentors can recommend
4. **Investor Prep:** Positioning clarity before demo day

Several accelerators including [Name 1] and [Name 2] already partner with us.

Open to exploring partnership? 20-minute call?
