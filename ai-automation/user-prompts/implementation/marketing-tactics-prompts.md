25. **Marketing Experiment Framework**
    ```
    Design a marketing experimentation framework:

    Experimentation philosophy:
    - Test velocity (experiments per quarter)
    - Risk tolerance
    - Learning goals

    Experiment types:
    - Channel tests (new channel viability)
    - Message tests (positioning, offers)
    - Audience tests (new segments)
    - Creative tests (ad formats, visuals)
    - Tactic tests (specific approaches)

    Experiment template:

    Hypothesis:
    - "We believe [change] will result in [outcome] because [reasoning]"

    Setup:
    - What we're testing
    - Control vs. variant
    - Success metric
    - Sample size needed
    - Duration
    - Budget

    Execution:
    - Implementation
    - Monitoring
    - Data collection

    Analysis:
    - Results vs. hypothesis
    - Statistical significance
    - Secondary insights
    - Recommendation (scale, iterate, kill)

    Learning capture:
    - Document findings
    - Share with team
    - Update playbooks
    - Feed future experiments

    Experimentation pipeline:
    - Backlog of ideas
    - Prioritization criteria
    - Review cadence
    - Resource allocation

    Build a culture of testing and learning.
    ```

3. **Test Everything**: A/B test before scaling

7. **Focus on ROI**: Prove marketing value
