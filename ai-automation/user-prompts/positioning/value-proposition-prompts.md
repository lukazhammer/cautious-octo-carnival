   4. Benefit-focused: [Outcome] for [audience] without [common obstacle]

   Provide 3-5 variations for testing.
   ```

2. **Problem-Solution Value Prop**
   ```
   Create a value proposition focused on problem-solution fit:

   Problem: [specific problem your audience faces]
   Why it matters: [impact of problem]
   Current solutions: [how they solve it today]
   Why those fail: [gaps in current solutions]
   Our solution: [how you solve it]
   Why it's better: [unique advantages]

   Craft a value proposition that:
   - Makes the problem vivid and relatable
   - Positions your solution as superior
   - Highlights specific advantages
   - Speaks in customer language
   ```

   Current state: [where they are now]
   Obstacles: [what prevents them]
   Our impact: [results we deliver]
   Proof: [evidence or metrics]

   For Audience A: [description]
   Their primary need: [what matters most]
   Value prop variation 1:

   For Audience B: [description]
   Their primary need: [what matters most]
